# Pairs

After running the file, the user must enter a comma-separated list of non-repeated integers on the command line and after a space enter the sum value and press enter. For example, a list of integers from 1 to 10 and a sum of 8 should be entered as:

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 8

After this the function will find and print on the console the pairs of integers that add up to the value given by the user.
For the same example, the result would be:

[ [ '1', '7' ], [ '2', '6' ], [ '3', '5' ] ]

## How to start?

-  The file can be run in the terminal by locating the file path and typing node pairs.js
